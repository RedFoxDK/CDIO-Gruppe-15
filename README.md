# CDIO Gruppe 15
## Background
This project is make for course 02343 CDIO-Project at Technical University of Denmark (DTU).

In the course we have to make a drone fly and navgitae around a unknow track where it has to fly throug 5 rings in diffent heighs. 
The drone has to fly all autonomy with not help from humans (except if it was about do crash).
We was giving 16 weeks (and 1 week holiday) where we only could work full time on it in the last 3 weeks.
The meaning for the course is to show that we work and thinking like a engineer, and slove a real life problem that we maybe will meet when we are done with our educatuion.

This part will be updating as far we get.

## Test information

This ROS package has been create and test on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS with ROS Indigo Igloo and Ardrone_autonomy driver for ROS Indigo Igloo. 
The drone was a Parrot ArDrone 2.0 Power Edition.

We have not test package on other version of ROS or Ardrone_autonomy and your test with the package will maybe fail. 
But it dose not mean you can look at our code, get to understand how use ROS and ardrone_autonomy and create your own version of our package for a other version
